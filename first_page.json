Psychopaths don\u2019t procrastinate, tend to focus on the positive, don\u2019t take things personally, don\u2019t beat themselves up if things go wrong, even if they\u2019re to blame, and they\u2019re assertive and cool under pressure. These can be good characteristics in both the business arena, and in everyday life.","thumbnail":"thumbs\/8s7ul8.jpg","thumbnail_width":140,"thumbnail_height":66,"label":"todayilearned","id":"8s7ul8","num_comments":371,"url":"https:\/\/www.smithsonianmag.com\/science-nature\/the-pros-to-being-a-psychopath-96723962\/"},{"title":"Transformation Tuesday! 164 pounds lost in 4 years.. feeling really proud of myself.","thumbnail":"thumbs\/8s7rs5.jpg","thumbnail_width":140,"thumbnail_height":140,"label":"pics","id":"8s7rs5","num_comments":288,"url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/uih7s6u5px411.jpg"},{"title":"The real reason to learn programming.","thumbnail":"thumbs\/8s7pdf.jpg","thumbnail_width":140,"thumbnail_height":140,"label":"ProgrammerHumor","id":"8s7pdf","num_comments":77,"url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/x8cafeqmmx411.jpg"},{"title":"Does this qualify?","thumbnail":"thumbs\/8s7ntf.jpg","thumbnail_width":140,"thumbnail_height":140,"label":"MapPorn","id":"8s7ntf","num_comments":143,"url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/03vg7da4lx411.jpg"},{"title":"Found in a crawl space, during Demolition work at Massachusetts Art Institute","thumbnail":"thumbs\/8s7my9.jpg","thumbnail_width":140,"thumbnail_height":117,"label":"gaming","id":"8s7my9","num_comments":74,"url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/olfwnzv7kx411.jpg"},{"title":"Americans own 40 percent of world's firearms: study","thumbnail":"","label":"worldnews","id":"8s7mgn","num_comments":827,"url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/americans-own-40-percent-worlds-firearms-study-173747656.html"},{"title":"The Blue Dragon River, Portugal","thumbnail":"thumbs\/8s7k0i.jpg","thumbnail_width":140,"thumbnail_height":140,"label":"interestingasfuck","id":"8s7k0i","num_comments":27,"url":"http:\/\/images.faena.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/4\/2016\/03\/15181825782029.jpg"},{"title":"BAbY fELInE CageD by MOnSteRS","thumbnail":"thumbs\/8s7ilf.jpg","thumbnail_width":140,"thumbnail_height":140,"label":"PeopleFuckingDying","id":"8s7ilf","num_comments":28,"url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/wruzo9n6lu411.jpg"},{"title":"Tourist be gone!","thumbnail":"thumbs\/8s7ifl.jpg","thumbnail_width":140,"thumbnail_height":140,"label":"lifehacks","id":"8s7ifl","num_comments":85,"url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/pjs72kl7fx411.jpg"},{"title":"Discord's too dangerous to be kept alive!","thumbnail":"thumbs\/8s7iat.jpg","thumbnail_width":140,"thumbnail_height":140,"label":"PrequelMemes","id":"8s7iat","num_comments":29,"url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/39ifjmizex411.png"},{"title":"watches porn once","thumbnail":"thumbs\/8s7htg.jpg","thumbnail_width":140,"thumbnail_height":116,"label":"niceguys","id":"8s7htg","num_comments":38,"url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/8kjx5tljex411.jpg"},{"title":"Gotti's user reviews on Rotten Tomatoes were artificially manipulated to be used in their marketing strategy","thumbnail":"","label":"movies","id":"8s7dle","num_comments":338,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/movies\/comments\/8s7dle\/gottis_user_reviews_on_rotten_tomatoes_were\/"},{"title":"England fans after one match","thumbnail":"thumbs\/8s7c3r.jpg","thumbnail_width":140,"thumbnail_height":73,"label":"sports","id":"8s7c3r","num_comments":234,"url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/ztbzm2md8x411.jpg"},{"title":"He just wanted some lunch","thumbnail":"thumbs\/8s75w0.jpg","thumbnail_width":140,"thumbnail_height":80,"label":"Wellthatsucks","id":"8s75w0","num_comments":155,"url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/yo5kppxb1x411.gif"},{"title":"When you taunt your opponent and have your guard down.
